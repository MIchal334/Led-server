# LED Control with ESP8266

## Overview

This project implements a program on the ESP8266 microcontroller to control WS2812B LED strips. The ESP8266 hosts a server that accepts data via a REST API, allowing users to set lighting modes, colors, and transition effects between colors. The code is primarily written in C++ with some functional programming elements to facilitate easy extension of functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **LED Type**: WS2812B
- **Communication Protocol**: REST API
